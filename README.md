#When we use a Variadic function: 

Variadic functions can be used instead of passing a slice to a function.
Variadic function is used when we donâ€™t know the number of parameters.
When you use variadic function in your program, it increases the readability of your program.
Variadic functions are especially useful when the arguments to your function are most likely not going to come from a single data structure (i.e. slice or array etc.).
In such cases using variadic functions avoids the creation of a data structure to just pass in the arguments to a function.
